#Assignment3 Part1 - 2D Design
So first I measured the arduino using freeCAD. 
The model was provided from [here](http://www.123dapp.com/smb-123D_Design/Arduino-Uno-R3/1677887).

My design was to create a simple box that has holes for the line ports, USB port, and the power port, using cardboards.

By zooming in, I was able to make more precise measurements.

Then, using the application [MakerCase](http://www.makercase.com/), I got a laser cut design for a box, given its dimensions.

I used inkscape to make holes on the box design.
