# Assignment 8: Software Prototype

For this assignment, our task was to get the first page (map) done with some buttons and a navigation view. 
So first, we used [google maps api](https://developers.google.com/maps/android/) to get the key and and display the map on our main page.

Then we added the navigation view (which opens up when the user slides the screen from left to right or clicks on the hamburger icon from the header. We also added two floating action buttons: one is for adding an item to the map and another is for showing the user's location.
