# Assignment 5: Sketching Final Project

Anjaly and I are working together for this final project.


## Problem:
We thought about problems that people have been facing.
One of which, my close sister told me she has a hard time keeping track of things she needs for her baby.
For example, diapers, wipes, toys, infant formula, etc. The list goes on and on.
You don't have to be a mom to have trouble finding your stuff.
People tend to forget where they placed keys, IDs, wallets, and other important items.

## Solution:
So, we thought it would be amazing to have an app where you could keep track of where things are.
A user would enter items about their locations by using gps or typing it. 
Then the user would be able to easily track where s/he placed the item the last time.
For traveling or moving, the user would turn on the gps and our app would keep track of where the user has traveled and mark down places stayed.
So if s/he lost something, s/he can go back the path traveled by looking at the map. 
Many people use smartphone nowadays. So downloading an app would be cost-free and easy to do. 
(Just downloading from an app store.)
