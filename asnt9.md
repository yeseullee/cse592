# Assignment: Design a User Study

To study how useful our app is and to learn human behavior, we have designed the following user study.
First, we would like to have two independent variables: app interface and gender. 
The dependent variable is the time it takes for them to find their belongings. 
So each participant will have two tests, one with the device and one without. 

First, he or she will be given a task to place 10 items anywhere they want in the building.
Next, we will ask the participant to bring back the items and measure the time it takes.
Then, we will give the participant a device with our app installed. 
The participant will enter the items, using the app, while placing the items at a new location.
Lastly, we will measure the time it takes for the participant to bring back the items.

When we receive the results, we will divide the data 
by the gender of the participant and study the patterns by gender (if there exists one).
This will show us which gender is more likely to use our app and further, imply which gender is more forgetful.

Our experiment is correlational because we would like to study the pattern between male and female users as well as the usefulness of our app.

This is a link for participants to fill out at the end of the experiment:
