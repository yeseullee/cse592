## Assignment: Make a Doodle
### Title: Magical Straw

The problem is, it is not always fun to drink with straws.
So, if you want to make it more fun to drink with straws, 
my idea is to make it work like a shower spray in your mouth!
I would like to test my technology with kids (6 and higher).
They would drink soda/water/juice with the magical straw and see how they use it.
I think they would love it. 
My success would be if most people like to use it, and do not have any problem with it.
